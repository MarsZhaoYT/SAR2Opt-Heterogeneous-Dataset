# Sar2Opt-Heterogeneous-Dataset

This is an overview of our proposed heterogeneous remote sensing images "SAR2Opt" dataset.  

Sar2Opt dataset can be used as a benchmark in __change detection__ and __image transaltion__ on remote sensing images.

## Description of dataset
We manually selected ground points on each pair of SAR-optical images to perform fine registration. All the pathces were cropped in size of 600*600 pixels after registration. If you want to use a pre-trained model, you could resize the patches first.

## Dataset
You can get the dataset from:
