# Sar2Opt-Heterogeneous-Dataset

This is an overview of our proposed heterogeneous remote sensing images "SAR2Opt" dataset.  

Sar2Opt dataset can be used as a benchmark in __change detection__ and __image transaltion__ on remote sensing images.

## Description of dataset
We downloaded several source optical and SAR images from [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/) and ESA website and manually selected ground points on every images pairs to perform fine registration. All the pathces were cropped in size of 600*600 pixels after registration. If you want to use a pre-trained model, you could resize the patches first.
